Having experienced gender discrimination, I empathize with the values of HeforShe. Besides a full-time graduate student, I also work as a graphic designer for WITOPS, a non-profit that challenges the paradigm of work-life for women in tech. It's work aligns with that of HeforShe and is dedicated to attaining gender equity at the workplace. As a graphic designer, I produce collections for digital and print purposes. I look after the execution of the visual design and brand aesthetics. By doing so, I aim to create designs that educate masses to build a world of equal representation.\n",

I have been working with Credit Suisse as technology analyst since I graduated as a Computer Engineer from the College of Engineering Pune. My most enjoyable professional experiences have been two greenfield projects I have contributed to. The first was a big-data project for our firm-wide Global Markets AI/ML Sandbox that I developed almost single handedly. The second is my current project, which one of four pilot projects to prepare CFO Technology for the adoption of public cloud.\n",

            "The reason why I appreciate these projects is the opportunity to start from scratch with no architecture, unfamiliar technologies, direct business understanding  and being able to spin up an MVP in a few months, and then scale it enterprise-wide. I have been working almost exclusively in the Agile methodology since graduation. In fact, I organised Credit Suisse‚Äôs partnership for the Pune Agile UnConference in 2019 and have been part of multiple forums and trainings since. \n",
